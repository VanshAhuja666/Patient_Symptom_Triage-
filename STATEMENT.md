# Problem Statement

Many people ignore early symptoms or do not know how serious their condition might be. 
This can delay medical attention and increase health risks. There is no simple basic 
console-based tool available that helps students understand how symptom-based triage works.

This project aims to create a basic patient symptom triage system using Python.

# Scope of Project

The system is built using only core Python concepts such as variables, input/output, 
functions, lists, dictionaries and conditional statements. No GUI or advanced libraries 
are used.

The program works in console mode and helps classify patients based on symptoms and 
vital signs into three categories: Urgent, Moderate, and Mild.

# Target Users

1. Health informatics students
2. Beginner Python learners
3. Anyone wanting to understand basic patient triage logic

# High-Level Features

1. Collects patient information such as age, symptoms and vital signs.
2. Applies rule-based logic to analyze symptoms.
3. Classifies patient risk level.
4. Suggests affected body system and department.
5. Displays medical advice based on condition.
