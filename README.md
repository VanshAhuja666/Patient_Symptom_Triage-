# Patient_Symptom_Triage-
A basic Python project that takes patient symptoms and vital signs, applies simple rule-based logic to identify the affected body system, and classifies the case as urgent, moderate, or mild. Designed for health informatics learning using only core Python concepts.
# Patient Symptom Triage System
## Overview
This is a console-based Python project that accepts basic patient details like symptoms 
and vital signs and classifies the condition as Urgent, Moderate, or Mild using 
rule-based logic. It also identifies the main affected system and suggests a department.

This project is developed using only basic Python concepts without using any AI, GUI, 
or external libraries.

## Features
- Takes patient symptoms and vital signs as input.
- Applies rule-based decision logic.
- Classifies patient condition into three levels.
- Identifies body system affected.
- Gives health advice for each case.
- Modular Python file structure.

## Technologies Used
